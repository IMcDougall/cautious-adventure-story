This is a cautious adventure story about a cautious adventurer adventuring cautiously.
The Cautious Adventurer (CA as he will be described), was, as stated, a cautious adventurer.
He had been cautious his entire life, and continued to be cautious up until the present moment.
The CA was currently cautiously adventuring in the ruinous remains of a Roman racetrack, the
Circus Maximum, where he was searching for the Sacred Sword of Saturn, with little luck.

The CA roamed the ruinous remains of the Roman racetrack when he came across a larger than 
normal rock.  CA cautiosly turned over the rock, revealing the Sacred Sword of Saturn.  
The CA cautiously removed the Sacred Sword of Saturn.  He held the sword in his hand, when, 
suddenly he noticed something approach from behind him....

When CA thought his luck couldn't be any better, the overshading figure behind him was his
cautious mentor. Little did CA know, that it was truly an aparition of Saturn. CA, weilding
the sword as an inheritence from the almighty god of time was mystically  bestowed with 
the very power to control the linearity, progress, or even cessation of time. CA cautiously 
weighs what this powerful ability could bring him before cautiously deciding his first course
of action.

CA set out to restore peace and tranquility to all things in the universe. He 
gives all people the proper resources to live a fulfilling life, and ends 
wars inter galactically. Just when the universe was ready to crown him the 
overlord of all things, CA was suddenly shot out of his existence into a new
world, where it was revealed to him that from the start, he was a bot placed 
into a simulation for experimentation on the emotion of cautiousness. It was 
determined that being cautious was the meaning of life.
